LOAN APPROVAL EDA PROJECT

This project provides an in-depth analysis of a loan approval dataset, exploring the relationships between various financial and demographic factors that influence loan amounts and approval decisions. The analysis includes a series of visualizations that depict the distribution of applicant incomes, loan amounts, and other key variables, as well as correlations among these variables.

Key findings from this project include:

- A moderate positive correlation between applicant income and loan amount, highlighting the importance of income in loan eligibility.
- Significant variations in loan amounts based on educational levels, with graduates generally receiving larger loans.
- The identification of patterns and outliers in income distribution, which may inform more tailored loan offerings.

This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis of a loan approval dataset, aimed at uncovering the key financial and demographic factors that influence loan eligibility. Throughout this project, various data processing techniques have been employed, including outlier detection and treatment using the IQR method. The analysis is driven by extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to provide meaningful insights into the dataset.

The project features a range of visualizations that illustrate the distribution of critical variables such as applicant and co-applicant incomes, loan amounts, and the interplay between these financial metrics and demographic factors like education, gender, marital status, and property area. Among the visualizations is an advanced 3D scatter plot, which provides a multi-dimensional view of the correlations between applicant income, co-applicant income, and loan amounts, segmented by property area.

This repository also includes a detailed report summarizing the key findings from the analysis. The report highlights the significant factors that impact loan approval decisions, offering valuable insights for stakeholders in the financial services industry. Whether you are a data enthusiast, a financial analyst, or someone interested in the dynamics of loan approval processes, this repository provides a rich resource of data-driven insights and methodologies.
